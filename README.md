# MIT_xv6
This is a collection of works I did in the process of learning about xv6. 
xv6 is a basic OS system that helps me learn about UNIX-like interface.

These uploads only include the homeworks from the MIT course, not the labs, since I never got to do it in 28 days. Therefore, this is more my learning process rather than an open homework solution thing.
